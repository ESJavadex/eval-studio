Create a single HTML file that renders an animated SVG illustration of a solar system with the following requirements:
- The sun should be centered, colored with a radial gradient from bright yellow (#FFD700) to orange (#FF8C00)
- Include at least 5 planets orbiting the sun at different distances, sizes, and speeds
- Each planet should have a distinct color and orbit path (shown as a faint circle)
- The planets should animate continuously using SVG <animateTransform> or CSS animations (NO JavaScript required, but allowed)
- Add a starfield background using small white/gray circles or dots scattered randomly
- Include labels for each planet (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter) positioned near their orbits
- Earth should have a tiny moon orbiting around it
- The entire illustration should be responsive and centered on the page
- Use a dark background (#0a0a2e)
- Include all CSS inline within <style> tags
- All graphics must be pure inline SVG — do NOT use any external images, libraries, or CDNs
