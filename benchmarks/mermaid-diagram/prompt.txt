Create a single HTML file that renders a complex diagram using the Mermaid.js library with the following requirements:
- Include Mermaid.js via CDN: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid/dist/mermaid.min.js
- Render THREE separate diagrams on the same page, stacked vertically with clear headings:

1. **Flowchart**: A software deployment pipeline showing:
   - Developer pushes code → CI runs tests → Tests pass/fail branch
   - If pass: Build Docker image → Push to registry → Deploy to staging → Run E2E tests → Deploy to production
   - If fail: Notify developer (loops back)
   - Use appropriate shapes (rectangles, diamonds for decisions, rounded for start/end)

2. **Sequence Diagram**: An authentication flow showing interactions between:
   - User, Frontend, Auth Service, Database, Token Store
   - Show: login request, credential validation, token generation, token storage, response with JWT
   - Include error path for invalid credentials

3. **Entity Relationship Diagram**: A simple e-commerce schema with:
   - Users (id, name, email)
   - Orders (id, user_id, total, status)
   - Products (id, name, price, stock)
   - OrderItems (order_id, product_id, quantity)
   - Show proper relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many)

- Use a dark theme (dark background #1a1a2e, light text)
- Style the page with a clean layout: centered content, max-width 900px, spacing between diagrams
- Each diagram should have a title/heading above it
- Initialize Mermaid with: theme 'dark', securityLevel 'loose'
- Include all CSS inline within <style> tags
