Context: You are designing the chronological system for a Mars colony that uses the "Isotope Calendar".

Calendar Rules:
- The year has 13 months.
- The first 12 months have exactly 28 days each (4 perfect weeks).
- Month 13 (called "Extra Month") has the remaining 29 days (to add up to 365).
- The week has 7 days: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun. Day 1 of Month 1 is always Monday.

Task: Create a single HTML file containing CSS and JavaScript (no external libraries or CDNs allowed) to:

1. **Conversion Function**: A function that receives an Earth date (e.g., February 20, 2026) and converts it to the corresponding Isotope Calendar date. The calculation must be manual: compute the day-of-year (1-365) from the Earth date, then map it to your 28-day months. Do NOT use any date libraries — calculate everything by hand.

2. **Visual Interface**: A widget that displays:
   - The "current month" in this calendar as a grid.
   - A visual marker highlighting today's day.
   - A counter showing "Days remaining until end of year" in this system.

3. **Interactivity**: A date input so the user can test any day and see the calendar change visually.

Critical constraints:
- Month 13 MUST have exactly 29 days, not 28.
- Since each 28-day month starts on Monday, the grid must be a perfect 4x7 grid with NO gaps at the beginning of the month.
- Day 1 on Earth (January 1) = Month 1, Day 1 in Isotope Calendar.
- Day 29 on Earth (January 29) = Month 2, Day 1 in Isotope Calendar.
- Use a modern dark theme with clean styling. You may use inline Tailwind-style utility classes or write your own CSS.
- Everything must be in a single HTML file with inline CSS and JavaScript.
- Do NOT use any external libraries, CDNs, or frameworks.
