          <iframe srcdoc="&lt;think&gt; Okay, let's tackle this problem. I need to create an Isotope Calendar system using only pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any external dependencies. The requirements are quite specific, so I should break it down step by step.

First, the conversion function: take a date like February 20, 2026, compute its day-of-year (1-365), then map that to the Isotope Calendar's months. Since month 13 has 29 days instead of 28, and each 28-day month starts on Monday, I need to calculate the correct offset for month 13.

Wait, how do you convert a day number into the calendar? Let me think: The total days in each month are fixed except for month 13. Since months 1-12 have 28 days (4 weeks), and month 13 has 29. But since it's 365 days, let's see:

Total days = 365. The first 12 months contribute 12*28=336 days. So the remaining days are 365 - 336 = 29, which is for February 20 (assuming that's day 20 of month 1? Wait no, maybe I'm getting confused here). Wait, perhaps better to approach this step by step.

The function needs to take an Earth date and convert it into the Isotope Calendar. Let me think: The user inputs a date like &quot;2026-02-20&quot;. First, parse that into year, month, day.

Compute day_of_year = (year - 1900)*365 + (month -1)*30 + day - 1? Wait no, maybe better to compute the actual day of the year correctly. Alternatively, since I need to calculate it manually without libraries, perhaps:

Wait, for any given date, day_of_year is calculated as:

day = (year % 100) * 365 + (month % 12)*30 + day -1? Not sure. Wait maybe better formula: The standard way to compute day of year from a Gregorian calendar date:

Let me recall the formula for day of year:

For dates before March 1, it's (year-1900)*365 + (month-1)*30 + day - 1. But if after February, then add 31*(number of months passed) etc. Hmm maybe better to use a standard method here. Alternatively, since I need to compute the day_of_year manually for any given date, perhaps:

Let me think of an example: For January 1st, 2026 is day 1 (since Jan has 28 days). So day_of_year = 1. February 20 would be in month 2, so 28 + 20 -1? Wait no, wait the formula for Gregorian calendar's day of year:

Wait perhaps it's easier to compute as follows: For a given date (year, month, day):

day_of_year = ((year % 100) * 365) + ((month - 1) * 30) + (day - 1). But this might not be accurate. Alternatively, maybe use the following method for Gregorian calendar:

The formula is:

day_of_year = day + (31*(month-1)/12) + (30*(month-2)/13) + ((year - year % 100) / 4) - ((year - year % 100) / 400) - ((month - 2)/12) + 1

Wait maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the user expects a simplified approach given that month 13 has 29 days and each 28-day months start on Monday. Since this is getting too complex for manual calculation, maybe we can find a way to compute it step by step without relying on libraries.

Alternatively, since I need to write code in my head, perhaps the key points are:

The month starts on Monday. So for any given date, the first day of the month must be a Monday. Therefore, if the current day is not a Monday, we have to adjust by moving days back or forward until it's a Monday. For example, if the desired day is Tuesday (day 2), then subtract one day.

Wait maybe I should structure this as follows: To convert an Earth date into Isotope Calendar:

1. Calculate total days since January 1, 1900 (or some base?), but perhaps better to compute the day of year from the given date.

Alternatively, let's think of the conversion steps:

The goal is to map any Earth date to an Isotope Calendar date. Let me outline the steps for converting a given Earth date into Isotope Calendar:

First, determine which month and day it is in the calendar. Since months 1-12 have 28 days (4 weeks), each starting on Monday. The first day of each month must be a Monday. So if the user inputs a date like January 20, 2026 (which is a Tuesday?), we need to adjust so that the first day of the month is a Monday.

Wait perhaps the process is:

Given an Earth date (year, month, day), compute its day_of_year (1-based). Then, determine which month it falls into based on cumulative days. The key points are:

- Month 13 has 29 days instead of 28.
- Each 28-day month starts on Monday. So the first day of each month must be a Monday. Therefore, if the given date is not already starting on a Monday, we need to adjust it by adding or subtracting days until the first day of the month is a Monday.

For example: Suppose the user inputs &quot;2026-02-20&quot; (February 20). Let's see what day that is in Gregorian calendar. February 20, 2026: since February has 28 days (since it's not a leap year?), wait 2026 is a leap year (divisible by 4 and not by 100 unless also by 400; 2026/4=506, so yes). Wait 2026 divided by 4 is 506.5? No, 2026 ÷4 = 506.5 → no, wait 4×506=2024, remainder 2. So it's not a leap year. Wait 2026 mod 4 is 2, so February has 28 days.

Wait let me check: 2026 divided by 4 is 506*4 = 2024; 2026-2024=2 → remainder 2 → not divisible by 4. So February has 28 days. Wait but the user said month13 has 29, so perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait maybe better to compute day_of_year for a given date:

Let me pick an example: suppose the input is &quot;2026-02-20&quot;. Let's see what that day is in Gregorian calendar.

Using formula: For dates after February 28 (since Feb has 28 days), so let's calculate day of year:

Assuming it's a leap year? Wait no, 2024 was a leap year but 2026 divided by 4 gives remainder 2 → not divisible by 4. So February has 28 days.

Wait perhaps better to use an online calculator or formula here. Alternatively, let me proceed with the algorithm:

The key steps for converting Earth date (year, month, day) into Isotope Calendar:

1. Compute total_day_of_year = (year % 100)*365 + (month -1)*30 + day - 1? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps use this formula from Wikipedia's Gregorian calendar page:

The day of the year is calculated as follows:

day = (year % 100) * 365 + (month - 1) * 30 + (day - 1). But if that gives a value greater than 365? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps better to use this method:

Wait here's a standard formula for day of year from Gregorian calendar date (year, month, day):

If the date is before March 1, it's (year-1900)*365 + (month -1)*30 + day -1. But if after February, then add 31*(number of months passed) etc. This might be too time-consuming. Let me try to find a better way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the total days since January 1, 1900:

day_of_year = (year - 1900)*365 + (month -1)*30 + day -1. But this would give values up to 365*(year-1900) + ... but maybe not accurate for all dates. For example, if the date is January 1, 1900:

day_of_year = (0)*365 + 0 + 1 -1 = 0? No, that can't be right. Hmm perhaps I need to look up a correct formula. Alternatively, let me proceed with an example. Let's say the user inputs &quot;2026-02-20&quot;.

Suppose we want day_of_year for this date:

Assuming it's in February 2026 (non-leap year). The calculation would be:

(2026 - 1900) * 365 = 126*365 = let's see, but perhaps better to compute via another method. Alternatively, maybe I can proceed with the following approach for manual calculation:

The user wants a function that takes an Earth date and returns the corresponding Isotope Calendar date. Let me try to outline steps without libraries:

First, determine if it's month 13 or not. If not, then check which month it is. For months 1-12, each has 28 days starting on Monday. The first day of the month must be a Monday. So for example, if the desired date is February 20 (2026), let's see:

February 20 is in month 2. Let me check what day of week it was. If I can't compute exactly without a calculator, perhaps proceed with an algorithm that ensures the first day of each month starts on Monday. So for any given date, adjust the day to be a Monday by adding or subtracting days until the first day is a Monday.

Suppose the user inputs &quot;2026-02-20&quot;. Let's see: February 20, 2026. Let me check what day that was. Since I can't compute exactly here, perhaps assume that it's Tuesday (so need to subtract one day). But maybe proceed with code logic.

The key steps for the conversion function:

1. Calculate total days since January 1, 1900 (or another base?), but let's say from a specific date. Alternatively, compute the day of year as follows:

Let me try to write pseudocode:

function isotope_calendar(date) {
    const y = parseInt(date.year);
    const m = parseInt(date.month);
    const d = parseInt(date.day);

    // Compute day of year
    let day_of_year = (y - 1900)*365 + (m-1)*30 + d -1;
    if (is_leap(y)) {
        day_of_year += (y %4 ==0 &amp;&amp; y%100 !=0 || y%400==0);
    }

    // Now determine which month it's in
    let months = [&quot;January&quot;, &quot;February&quot;, ..., &quot;December&quot;];
    const month_index = m -1;
    let start_day = day_of_year - (months[month_index].length * 30 + days_in_month);

    // Find the first day of the month that is a Monday
    for (let i=0; i&lt;7; i++) {
        const day = start_day + i;
        if ((i %7 ==0 &amp;&amp; day%7 ===1) || 
            (i%7==0 &amp;&amp; day%7==2) || ... ) // Wait, perhaps better to compute the first day of the month as Monday.

    Alternatively, find the offset needed so that the first day is a Monday. Let me think: The first day of each month must be a Monday. So if the current day_of_year corresponds to a certain date, we need to adjust it such that the first day of the month is Monday. 

    For example, suppose the given date's day_of_year is D. To find the start_day:

    Let target_first_day = Monday (0). The current first day is (D mod7). We can compute how many days to add or subtract to reach a Monday.

    So desired_delta = (Monday - (current_day_of_year %7)) %7 → but maybe better:

    Let target_first_day = 0 (Monday). The current day of the month is D mod7. To get from current first day to Monday, need delta = (0 - (D%7)) mod7. Wait perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe an easier way: compute the desired starting day as Monday, so if the current date's day_of_year corresponds to a certain offset, adjust it by adding or subtracting days until the first day of the month is a Monday.

    Once that's done, then the start_day becomes Monday. Then check if the month has 28 or 29 days (if m==13). For months 1-12: 28 days, so if the starting day isn't Monday, adjust by adding/subtracting days to reach next Monday.

    Once the first day of the month is a Monday, then compute the remaining days in the month. Since each 28-day month starts on Monday, the last day would be (start_day + (days_in_month -1)) mod7? Wait perhaps this is getting too involved. Maybe I should proceed with code logic steps:

    Once start_day is adjusted to a Monday, then check if it's month13. If yes, set days_in_month =29 else 28. Then the day of the month for that month would be (start_day + (days_in_month -1)) mod7 → but need to ensure it wraps around properly.

    Once all these are done, then compute the current date's day in this calendar:

    The total days since Jan 1 is day_of_year. The first day of month m is start_day (Monday). So the offset from start_day would be (start_day - D) mod7 → but perhaps better to calculate the end day as (start_day + (days_in_month-1)) %7 ?

    This is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I'll proceed with writing code that handles these steps, even if it's a bit involved.

2. The visual interface: A grid of 4x7 days. Each row represents a month? Wait the Isotope Calendar has months 1-12 (28 days) and month13 as extra month (29). So each month is either 28 or 29 days, starting on Monday. The grid must be a perfect 4x7? No, wait there are 12 regular months plus an extra month (month13), so total 13 months. But the user wants a 4x7 grid with no gaps at the start of the month. Wait perhaps each month is represented as a row in the grid, and since it's 13 months, but arranged into 4 rows? Not sure yet.

Wait maybe the grid is structured such that there are four columns (months) and seven days per column? Or perhaps the user wants a single row with 28-day months except month13 which has 29. The exact visualization might be tricky without seeing it, but since I need to create an HTML file with inline CSS and JS, perhaps the grid is a 4x7 layout where each month's block is either 28 or 29 days, starting on Monday.

3. The counter: Days remaining until end of year. Since months have varying lengths (12*28 +29 = 365), so total days in all months except month13 are 12*28=336 plus 29 → 365? Wait no: 12*28 is 336, plus 29 gives 365. So the counter would be (total_remaining_days - current_day).

Putting this together into a single HTML file with inline CSS and JS. Need to avoid external libraries, so all styles must be in a style tag or within a div? Wait no, since it's one HTML file, I can't have multiple style tags unless nested properly. Alternatively, use a &lt;style&gt; block inside the head.

The challenge is to write everything inline without any external resources. Let me outline:

- The HTML structure will be a single file with embedded CSS and JS.
- Use a grid layout for the calendar (4 columns?), but since it's 13 months, perhaps each month is a row in a table-like structure, but using flex or grid. Since inline styles are needed, maybe use divs with flexbox.
- The counter will be a variable that updates based on current date.
- Visual markers: today's day highlighted, and the countdown timer.

Now, writing all this into one HTML file with embedded CSS and JS. Need to ensure no external resources, so everything is self-contained.

Let me draft the code step by step, ensuring it fits in a single file without any external dependencies.
